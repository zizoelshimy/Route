//1st q
forEach and for...of both let you iterate over items
forEach
Cannot use break, continue, or return to exit early (except by throwing an error).
for...of
Supports break, continue, and return inside the loop.

-Hoisting is JavaScript’s behavior of moving declarations (not assignments) to the top of their scope during compilation, before the code executes.
-The TDZ is a period between entering a scope and the moment a let or const variable is initialized.
During this time, accessing the variable throws a ReferenceError.
for ex:
console.log(x); 
let x = 10;
this will give error 
but with var will give undefiend if var
//3rd question
=== check the value and type>>>>>>>>> 5 === "5"  // false
== check the value only >>>>>>>>>>>>5 == "5"  // true
//4th question
try {
  // Code that might throw an error
} catch (error) {
  // Code that runs if an error occurs
} finally {
  // (optional) code that always runs, even after return
}
JavaScript executes the try block.

If no error occurs → skip catch, run finally (if present).

If an error is thrown inside try:

It immediately stops running the rest of the try block.

Control jumps to the catch block.

The error object contains info about what went wrong.

1. Type Conversion (Explicit Conversion)
You intentionally convert a value from one type to another using functions or constructors.
Ex:
String(123);     // "123"
(123).toString(); // "123"
2. Type Coercion (Implicit Conversion)
Happens implicitly when operators need matching types.
Ex:
String + Number → String
"5" + 1   >>>>>>>>>> "51"
Number + Boolean → Number
1 + true   >>>>>>>>>>2   (because true → 1)
