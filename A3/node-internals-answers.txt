1. What is the Node.js Event Loop? 
The event loop is a mechanism in Node.js that allows non-blocking, asynchronous operations. It continuously checks for tasks, executes them, and waits for more work, enabling Node.js to handle many operations at once without blocking the main thread.

2. What is Libuv and What Role Does It Play in Node.js? 
Libuv is a C library that provides Node.js with an event loop, asynchronous I/O, and cross-platform support. It handles operations like file system access, networking, and timers, making Node.js asynchronous and efficient.

3. How Does Node.js Handle Asynchronous Operations Under the Hood? 
Node.js uses the event loop and libuv to manage asynchronous operations. When an async task (like reading a file) is started, it is handed off to the system or thread pool. When finished, a callback is placed in the event queue to be executed by the event loop.

4. What is the Difference Between the Call Stack, Event Queue, and Event Loop in Node.js? 
- Call Stack: Where function calls are made and executed one at a time.
- Event Queue: Holds callbacks waiting to be executed.
- Event Loop: Moves callbacks from the event queue to the call stack when the stack is empty, enabling async execution.

5. What is the Node.js Thread Pool and How to Set the Thread Pool Size? 
Node.js uses a thread pool (from libuv) for some operations (like file I/O, DNS, crypto). The size can be set with the environment variable UV_THREADPOOL_SIZE (default is 4).

6. How Does Node.js Handle Blocking and Non-Blocking Code Execution? 
Blocking code stops the event loop until it finishes, while non-blocking code allows the event loop to continue running other tasks. Node.js encourages non-blocking code using callbacks, promises, and async/await.
